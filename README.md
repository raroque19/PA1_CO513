Insights in programming ARM Assembly -
"Overall, it is really important to familiarize and understand how registers work-its functions, and what it represents base on the code you run, and most importantly, know appropriate intructions for addressing, storing memory, bit manipulation, arithmetic operations, and so on to ease your coding".
